# ArdOS
The goal of this projekt is to build an extensible Operating System like Software for Arduino boards from which you can launch programs and change settings.
The base is a fork of [microBox from Sebastian DÃ¼ll (wastel7)](https://github.com/wastel7/microBox) and the extra programs are mostly maintained in the [JoUtils lib](https://github.com/jo-huck/joUtils)
